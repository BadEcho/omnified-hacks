# Omnified Legacy Hacks
[What Is Omnified?](https://badecho.com/index.php/what-is-omnified/)

This is a historical archive of the complete collection of Omnified games that were produced prior to the adoption
of the formalized Omnified 2.0 framework (which targets found [here](https://github.com/omniscientist/BadEcho/tree/master/hacks/targets) implement).

Each game is chronologically listed; the prefixed number in the filenames reflect the order in which the hacks were written since
the beginning of the Omnified experiment during November 2019.

This essentially documents the progress and evolution of what it meant to be "Omnified". You can see the origins of many of the defining game-neutral systems inside these files.

Unlike the modern targets that implement an actual framework, these are standalone Cheat Table files, with all relevant injected assembly located inside the .ct file itself (having the idea and figuring out how to separate the assembly from the clunky .ct file format didn't happen overnight!).

## Data Structures and Binary Assets Are Not Present

In order to reduce file size, the reverse engineered data structures were removed, these might be published later, however their main value was in the development of the core hacks that get injected. Binary files, such as sound file assets, are also not included for purposes of file readability. Refer to the modern target .ct files for binary payloads that will function just fine with these.

## No Support or Guarantee That Legacy Hacks Are Operational

While there is absolutely zero support being offered by myself for any of these older titles, I am quite certain that there's some valuable hacking information in more than a few of them that some intrepid binary explorers out there will find quite useful.

It's been a while since I hacked these games and [broadcasted their playthroughs on stream](https://twitch.tv/omni), so if there have been any updates to any of these games, you will probably have to fix them on your own. 

Luckily for you, I've written an [article on how to fix out-of-date hacks](https://badecho.com/index.php/2021/10/05/fixing-hacks-after-patch/) that you may find useful.
